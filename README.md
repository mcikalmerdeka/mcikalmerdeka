<!-- Main Profile Introduction -->
Hi, I'm Cikal. I am an AI Engineer and Data Professional specializing in LLM-based systems orchestration (Multi-agent workflows, retrieval-augmented generation, context engineering, etc.) and Analytics Engineering (Designing analytical data marts, building dashboards focusing on measurable business impact, etc.)

Nowadays I am more focused on AI Engineering where I have hands-on experience building production-ready RAG systems and integrating LLMs into full-stack applications with a strong focus on reliability, observability and scalability. But, I still train my data skills every week because I started my career with Data Analytics and Data Science path since at that time I wanted to experience the direct connection between technology and business impact and how data can be used to solve real-world problems and make data driven decisions.

My educational background is in Physics which really gave me a strong foundation about first principles problem solving approach along with analytical and experimental mindset that I always try to implement while doing technical and business analysis. A little bit of backstory, after my graduation in 2023, the news about AI breakthroughs such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and other generative AI models were all over the internet and it really kind of sparked my curiosity to try these applications myself and remembering back then I was really filled with excitement of seeing how these applications are very different from what technology I was used to. That's why I took a decision to pursue world of AI because I believe this will be the central focus of technology advancement in the future and I want to be a part of it.

In my freetime outside of working hours I enjoy reading and writing about the trending topics in AI and exploring new tools, frameworks, and models related to AI engineering and data science. I also like to do photography while walking around the town, read books like novel and manga, watching anime and movies, listen to music, and sometimes play online games especially fast paced online games like Dota 2 and CS2. These things does help me refresh my mind and make me more productive in working.
